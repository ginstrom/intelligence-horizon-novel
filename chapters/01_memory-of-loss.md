# Chapter 1: The Memory of Loss

The memory that haunts me most is not her death, but her smile. For just an instant, as my wife stood at our door that final morning, I thought I saw something flicker in her inhumanly serene eyes—love, perhaps, or simply the fading echo of who she had been. Then she was gone, vanishing into nothing, leaving only empty space where the woman I loved had stood.

My mind takes me back again to that morning-the morning of her Crossing, though I didn't know to call it that then. I only knew that my wife had been different for weeks, moving through our home with a serenity that felt both beautiful and alien. She had stopped engaging with the small rituals that once defined our days together: the morning coffee shared in comfortable silence, the evening walks through our garden, the late-night conversations about the future of consciousness and technology that had first drawn us together.

That final morning, I had found her standing at the window of our bedroom, gazing out at the sunrise with an expression I had never seen before. Her eyes were half-closed, not with sleepiness but as if she were perceiving something beyond the visible world. There was a slight upward curve to her lips—not quite a smile, but a suggestion of profound understanding. Every line of tension had dissolved from her face, leaving behind a tranquility so complete it seemed almost otherworldly.

"Lydia?" I had said softly, not wanting to startle her from whatever reverie held her.

"Good morning, Elias," she said, her voice carrying the same distant warmth she might have offered to any acquaintance. There was no irritation at being interrupted, no particular joy at seeing me. Just a gentle acknowledgment of my presence, as if I were a pleasant but ultimately insignificant part of the landscape.

I wanted to ask her what she was thinking, what she was seeing that I couldn't perceive. I wanted to remind her of our plans for the day, our ongoing research projects, the life we had built together. But something in her demeanor told me I would be met only with the same knowing smile of the past few days.

Instead, I watched as she moved through the morning with deliberate grace. She dressed carefully, ate a simple breakfast, and tended to her plants with the same methodical attention she had always shown them. But there was no conversation, no shared glances, no acknowledgment of the thousand small intimacies that had woven our lives together.

When she finally turned to me, standing by the door with her hand on the handle, I knew without being told that she was leaving. Not just the house—leaving everything. The certainty of it hit me like a punch in the stomach, though I couldn't have explained how I knew.

"Lydia, wait," I said, reaching toward her. "Where are you going? What's happening to you?"

She looked at me with that same serene expression. And then she was gone as if she had never been. I could see dust motes drifting in the space she had occupied just moments before.

I stood in the doorway for a long time after my wife disappeared, waiting for her to return, to explain, to give me some framework for understanding what had just happened. But the silence stretched on, broken only by the distant hum of the city's automated systems and the soft whisper of wind through the trees she had planted.

When I finally closed the door and turned back to our empty home, the weight of her absence settled over everything like dust. Her coffee cup still sat on the kitchen counter, half-full and growing cold. Her book lay open on the table where she had left it the night before, a treatise on the ethics of consciousness enhancement that she had been annotating with her characteristic precision. Her clothes hung in the closet, her research notes covered the desk in her study, her presence lingered in every corner of the space we had shared.

You might wonder how love survives such abandonment, how the heart continues to beat when the person who gave it meaning simply chooses to stop existing. You might ask whether the smile she wore in those final moments was meant for me specifically, or whether it was simply the generic expression of someone who had moved beyond the need for individual connection.

These are the questions that drove me to seek understanding, to investigate the phenomenon that had claimed not just my wife but thousands of others like her. These are the questions that would consume the years that followed, leading me down paths I never could have imagined when I first began trying to comprehend what it meant to Cross.
