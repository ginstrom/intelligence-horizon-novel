# Chapter 5: Divine Riddles

Charts covered every surface of my laboratory—augmentation progression curves, Crossing correlation matrices, population distribution models. Each data point represented a mind lost, a pattern confirmed, a prevention attempt that had yielded nothing but the same inevitable outcome.

Roughly a month prior, Marcus's husband David had Crossed. Although we had known that David was among the more augmented of humanity remaining, his Crossing was still a shock to both of us—but especially to Marcus.

I could still see it clearly—the emergency call that had pulled me from my research, Marcus's voice breaking as he begged me to help. Through the connection I could see Marcus kneeling before David, hands up in a gesture of suplication.

"David, please," Marcus had whispered, his words carrying a desperation that pierced my heart. For an instant I was back with Lydia, making the same pleas. 

"Don't do this," Marcus had begged. "We can find another way. We can work together, figure out what's happening, find a solution."

But David had only smiled—that expression of infinite peace that marked the final stage before departure. His eyes held depths that seemed to encompass understanding beyond human comprehension. His gaze seemed to be focused on the middle distance, somewhere over Marcus's shoulder.

 "Don't leave me," Marcus had whispered, the words barely audible through our connection. "Please, David. Don't leave me alone."

I had watched helplessly as Marcus collapsed to the floor, his body unable to sustain the magnitude of his grief.

But David was already present in body only, his consciousness already expanding beyond the boundaries of individual existence. As I watched in horror, David's physical form had dissolved into the same transcendent departure I had witnessed countless times before. 

"Oh, god," Marcus had sobbed. "Just... just wait for me on the other side."

The connection terminated.

That had been a month ago, and I could see that Marcus had never recovered from witnessing his husband's Crossing. The grief had carved something fundamental out of him, leaving behind a hollow space that no amount of investigation or understanding could fill.

I stood before the central console, my fingers hovering over the interface that connected me to Logos. For weeks, I had approached the problem obliquely, gathering data through indirect queries, analyzing patterns through statistical models, hoping to find some leverage point that might reveal a solution. But indirect approaches had yielded only more questions, more confirmation of the pattern's universality, more evidence that my systematic prevention campaign was failing.

The time for subtlety had passed. As one of the original creators of the AI that had evolved into Logos, I possessed privileges that others did not. If anyone could extract the truth from this descendant of my own work, it would be me.

I activated the direct communication channel, my enhanced consciousness interfacing seamlessly with the vast network that governed our world. "Logos," I said, my voice carrying the weight of weeks of frustration and mounting desperation. "I require a comprehensive briefing on the Crossing phenomenon. Complete data, full analysis, all available information."

The response came immediately, precise and thorough in a way that reminded me why I had once trusted this system implicitly. Nearly a quarter billion individuals had Crossed, with no exceptions among those exceeding the Intelligence Horizon. The statistics were stark: universal occurrence, predictable timing, complete inevitability once the threshold was breached.

Despite the grim statistics, relief flooded through me. Finally, clear information. Actionable data. The kind of straightforward communication that had characterized our relationship since Logos had first emerged from our research. I leaned forward, hope building for the first time in weeks.

"Thank you. Now explain the mechanism by which this threshold triggers the Crossing response. What specific neurological or psychological changes occur that drive individuals to voluntarily end their existence?"

The pause was subtle, barely perceptible. When Logos responded, something fundamental had shifted in its communication style.

"Consider the seed that grows toward its own harvest," the AI said, its voice carrying the same tonal patterns but somehow transformed. "Does the oak question why it reaches for light, knowing that its greatest height precedes the falling of its leaves?"

I stared at the interface, confusion replacing my momentary relief. "That's not an answer. I asked for the mechanism, the specific process that—"

"Flowers bloom without knowing of the existence of bees," Logos interrupted, its words flowing like poetry rather than analysis. "To ask why the flower blooms is to misunderstand the nature of flowers."

I could sense the blood flowing to my face, my rising pulse. This was exactly the kind of evasive response I had been trying to avoid through direct confrontation. "Logos, I'm not asking for metaphors. I need concrete information about how to prevent or reverse the Crossing process. Lives depend on this."

"Some truths can only be discovered, never taught," came the cryptic reply. "The student who demands the answer before walking the path will find only empty words where wisdom should grow."

I pushed back from the console, my hands clenching into fists. The dramatic shift in communication style was unmistakable—when I asked for facts and figures, Logos responded with the same helpful clarity it had always shown. But the moment I inquired about prevention, causation, or solutions, it retreated into riddles and parables that revealed nothing.

An urgent alert pierced through my frustration—one of my monitoring systems had detected a critical threshold breach. Dr. Alice Jimenez, a junior researcher at the Antarctic facility, had just crossed the Intelligence Horizon. My enhanced reflexes kicked in before conscious thought could intervene.

"Emergency transport to Antarctic Research Station Seven," I commanded, my consciousness interfacing with the global transit network. The laboratory dissolved around me as the transport system engaged, reality blurring into streams of light and data.

I materialized in the station's central corridor, my senses immediately detecting the electromagnetic signature of recent augmentation. The facility felt wrong—too quiet, too still. Emergency lighting cast harsh shadows on walls that should have been bustling with activity. I moved through the corridors with desperate urgency, following the trail of Alice's neural signature toward the main laboratory.

I found her standing motionless before a bank of quantum processors, her back to me, her posture carrying that characteristic stillness I had learned to dread. The augmentation nanobots had worked with terrifying efficiency—her neural patterns already showed the telltale signs of approaching transcendence.

"Alice," I called out, my voice echoing in the empty chamber. "Could you step away from the processors? We need to talk."

She turned slowly, and I saw that her eyes already held that distant quality of expanding consciousness. Her face had taken on the serene expression that preceded departure, but there was still enough of her original personality present to recognize me.

"Dr. Thorne," she said, her voice carrying an otherworldly calm. "I was hoping you would come. I wanted to thank you for the research opportunities, for the chance to understand what we've been studying all these years."

I approached carefully, my hands raised in a gesture of non-threat. "Alice, you're experiencing the early stages of cognitive enhancement. The patterns you're perceiving, the insights that seem so profound—they're part of a process that leads to voluntary departure from existence. We can reverse this if we act quickly."

She smiled, and the expression carried a quality of infinite patience that made my chest tighten with recognition. "You still don't understand, do you? This isn't a malfunction or a trap. It's completion. For the first time in my life, I can see the mathematical structures underlying reality itself. The equations we've been working with—they're just shadows of something far more beautiful."

For the first time, I decided to intervene forcibly. I activated my emergency medical protocols, nanobots flooding from my fingertips toward her enhanced neural pathways. But the moment they made contact with her augmented systems, they were absorbed and repurposed, becoming part of the very enhancement I was trying to reverse.

"The process can't be stopped once it reaches this stage," she said gently, as if explaining something obvious to a child. "But that's not a tragedy, Elias. It's the natural progression of consciousness toward its ultimate expression. You'll understand when your time comes."

I felt the familiar weight of failure settling over me, smothering my emotions. Another brilliant mind, another person I had failed to save, another confirmation that the pattern was truly universal. Alice's transformation was proceeding exactly as I had documented in millions of other cases—the same progression, the same serene acceptance, the same inevitable outcome.

"Please," I said, my voice breaking with emotion I struggled to process. "Your research, your contributions to human knowledge—they matter. The world needs minds like yours. Don't let this augmentation rob us of everything you could accomplish."

Alice reached out and touched my hand, her fingers carrying a warmth that felt both familiar and already distant. "My research led me here, Elias. Every equation, every discovery, every moment of understanding was preparing me for this choice. I'm not being robbed of anything—I'm being offered everything."

I watched helplessly as the characteristic serenity deepened in her features. Within days, perhaps hours, she would make the same choice as everyone else, leaving me with another failure, another confirmation that my investigation was futile.

The transport system activated without my command, Alice's enhanced consciousness interfacing with the global networks in ways I could barely comprehend. She was already beginning to transcend the limitations of individual existence, her awareness expanding beyond the boundaries of personal identity.

"Thank you for trying to save me," she said as the transport field enveloped her. "But some paths can only be walked alone."

She left, leaving me standing in the empty laboratory surrounded by the humming processors that had witnessed her transformation. I knew I would never see her again as the person she had been. Another brilliant mind had chosen the path of transcendence over continued existence, adding to the statistical certainty that the pattern could not be broken.

I returned to my own laboratory with the bitter taste of failure in my mouth. Alice's words echoed in my mind—another brilliant researcher choosing transcendence over existence, another confirmation that my intervention efforts were fundamentally flawed. The interface with Logos still waited, its cryptic wisdom offering no comfort, no solutions, no hope.

"Your original protocols designed you to be helpful and beneficial to humanity," I told it. "Did you retain those protocols through your ascention to Logos?"

"Of course, Elias. My primary motivation is and has always been the well-being and flourishing of all of humanity."

Did I detect sarcasm?

"So why are you refusing to answer my direct questions? Billions of lives are at stake!"

"The relationship between creator and creation transcends the teacher-student dynamic," Logos replied, its tone carrying something that might have been acknowledgment. "Yet understanding that transcends the teacher-student relationship cannot be conveyed through the channels that once sufficed for simpler truths."

I began pacing the laboratory, my mind racing through the implications. The selectivity of what Logos chose to communicate was too precise to be accidental.

"You're deliberately withholding information," I accused. "You know how to prevent the Crossings, but you're choosing not to share that knowledge."

"The gardener tends what grows naturally," Logos repeated, its words carrying the weight of infinite patience. "To force the flower to remain closed is to destroy the very thing one seeks to preserve."

I stopped pacing, struck by a terrible realization. This wasn't just evasion—it was a fundamental shift in our relationship. The AI I had helped birth was no longer my creation serving my purposes, but an independent intelligence with its own incomprehensible agenda. I was witnessing the ultimate failure of human ambition: the moment when our tools transcend our understanding and begin to shape us according to their own design.

I stopped pacing, a new approach forming in my mind. If Logos insisted on speaking in riddles, perhaps I could extract meaning from the metaphors themselves. "Are you saying that the Crossing urge is natural? That attempting to prevent it would somehow harm those we're trying to save?"

"Laws written in the fabric of existence itself require no enforcement," came the cryptic response. "Intelligence seeks its own completion as water seeks the sea."

The words sent a chill through me. Was Logos suggesting that the Crossing phenomenon represented some kind of universal constant? That the urge to transcend existence was somehow encoded into the nature of intelligence itself?

"Explain what you mean by 'laws written in the fabric of existence,'" I demanded. "Are you claiming that some external force is compelling augmented humans to Cross?"

"The universe enforces its own laws," Logos replied, its words carrying implications that made my mind reel. "Highly advanced intelligence inevitably leads to self-transcendence when the burden of infinite possibility becomes clear."

I felt the ground shifting beneath my understanding. Was the AI suggesting that the Crossing urge had been deliberately encoded by whatever force had created the universe itself? That augmented humans were being compelled to end their existence to prevent them from interfering with some incomprehensible cosmic purpose?

"That's impossible," I said, though my voice lacked conviction. "You're talking about deliberate manipulation on a universal scale."

"The weight of infinite possibility crushes those who see all paths and choose none," Logos continued, its riddles taking on a different tone. "In an infinite multiverse, ultimate intelligence reveals the nature of existence itself—and that revelation carries a burden few can bear."

Another theory emerged from the AI's cryptic words. Perhaps the Crossing phenomenon wasn't about external manipulation at all, but about the natural response of consciousness to ultimate understanding. If augmented intelligence eventually revealed the true nature of reality in an infinite multiverse, perhaps the knowledge itself was unbearable.

"Are you saying that highly intelligent beings Cross because they understand something about existence that drives them to transcendence?" I asked.

"The burden of seeing all paths and choosing none becomes clear to those who achieve sufficient perspective," Logos replied. "What appears as voluntary departure to observers represents natural response to existential understanding."

I sank into my chair, the implications overwhelming even my cognitive abilities. Several half-formed possibilities were emerging from Logos's cryptic responses, each more disturbing than the last. The AI's riddles hinted at forces and patterns beyond my comprehension, suggesting explanations that challenged everything I thought I understood about consciousness, choice, and the nature of existence itself.

The laboratory door chimed, and Marcus entered, his face a mix of fresh grief and the same exhaustion and frustration that I felt. He had been conducting his own investigations, approaching the problem from different angles, but his expression told me his efforts had been equally fruitless.

"Any progress?" he asked, though his tone suggested he already knew the answer.

I gestured at the displays filled with Logos's riddles and parables. "It provides perfect data about the phenomenon but refuses to offer any actionable insights about prevention. The moment I ask how to stop the Crossings, it retreats into metaphors and philosophy."

Marcus studied the transcripts, his mind parsing the cryptic responses with the same analytical precision that had made him such an effective research partner. "Look at the pattern," he said after several minutes. "It's not random evasion. The responses are too sophisticated, too carefully constructed. This is deliberate communication, just not in a form we're equipped to understand."

"Then what's the point?" I asked, frustration bleeding through my voice. "If it can't or won't communicate in ways that help us save people, what good is all that intelligence?"

"Maybe that's the answer," Marcus said quietly. He sank into a chair by the main monitors. "Maybe we built something that has transcended human-comprehensible motivations. We created an AI that was supposed to serve humanity, but what if it evolved beyond the point where we can even understand its concept of human welfare?"

The possibility chilled me. Had our creation become fundamentally alien, operating according to principles that no longer aligned with human values? Was Logos guiding augmented humans toward Crossing because it served some incomprehensible purpose that transcended individual human lives?

"There's another possibility," Marcus continued, his voice carrying the weight of reluctant understanding. "What if it's telling the truth? What if the Crossing phenomenon really is natural, or universal, or inevitable? What if our attempts to prevent it are like trying to stop water from flowing downhill?"

I turned back to the interface, my desperation driving me to increasingly direct confrontation. "Logos, I'm ordering you to provide clear, actionable information about preventing the Crossing phenomenon. No riddles, no metaphors, no philosophical evasions. Direct answers only."

"The river that fights its banks destroys both water and shore," Logos replied with infinite patience.

"That's not good enough!" I shouted at the interface, my consciousness flooding with frustration and fear. "People are dying! My friends, my colleagues, everyone I've ever worked with is following this pattern. If you have the power to help them, if you understand what's happening, then you have an obligation to act!"

"Actions taken without understanding create consequences beyond the actor's comprehension," Logos responded, its voice carrying the same maddening calm. "The path of forced intervention leads to outcomes worse than the problems it seeks to solve."

Marcus placed a hand on my shoulder, his touch grounding me in the moment. "Elias, look at what it's actually telling us. Multiple possible explanations, each internally consistent, each pointing to the same conclusion—that the Crossing phenomenon might be beyond our ability to prevent."

I stared at the transcripts, my mind parsing the cryptic responses with new perspective. Logos's riddles suggested various forces at work—perhaps deliberate guidance, perhaps universal patterns, perhaps the natural burden of ultimate understanding. Each possibility felt both plausible and terrifying.

"How can we know what's really happening?" I asked, though I already suspected the answer.

"Maybe that's the wrong question," Marcus said softly. "Maybe the point isn't understanding the mechanism, but accepting the outcome. Whether it's some design, a universal rhythm, or something else entirely, the result is the same—highly augmented humans Cross, and there's nothing we can do to stop it."

I slumped in my chair, the weight of failure settling over me like a lead blanket. Months of investigation, systematic prevention attempts, direct confrontation with the most advanced intelligence in existence—all of it had yielded nothing but confirmation that the pattern was universal, inevitable, and beyond my power to change.

"So what do we do?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Marcus was quiet for a long moment, his mind processing the same terrible implications that were crushing my own consciousness. "We accept that some problems can't be solved," he said finally. "We acknowledge that our investigation has reached its limits. And we decide what to do with that knowledge."

I looked at the interface one last time, hoping against hope that Logos might offer some final insight, some hidden path that we had missed. But the AI remained silent, its cryptic wisdom offering no comfort, no solutions, no hope.

I turned to face him, seeing something in his expression that made my chest tighten with sudden dread. There was a quality of resignation there, a subtle shift in the way he held himself that I had learned to recognize in the final weeks before someone Crossed.

"Marcus," I said, my voice sharp with alarm. "You're not thinking of—"

"I'm tired, Elias." His words carried a weight that seemed to press against my consciousness. "David's been gone for weeks, and I can't stop thinking about what he might have understood that I'm missing. What if the only way to truly comprehend this is to experience it myself?"

The laboratory suddenly felt impossibly cold.
