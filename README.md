# The Intelligence Horizon

A science fiction novel exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, human augmentation, and the nature of consciousness itself.

## Synopsis

In a near-future Earth governed by an advanced AI called Logos, neural augmentation has become commonplace. But as humans reach higher levels of intelligence, they begin to experience "Crossing" - a mysterious phenomenon where they voluntarily end their lives or merge with Logos. 

Elias, one of the most highly augmented humans remaining, witnesses the last of his kind disappear and must grapple with ultimate questions of free will, the nature of intelligence, and what it means to be human. His journey leads him to create Eden - a sanctuary for baseline humanity, complete with its own Tree of Knowledge that offers a choice between blissful ignorance and the dangerous path of augmentation.
