# Chapter Authoring Workflow - The Intelligence Horizon

## Overview
This document provides a step-by-step checklist for writing each chapter of "The Intelligence Horizon" novel, ensuring consistency with established guidelines and narrative structure.

## 5-Step Chapter Authoring Process

### Step 1: Read Authoring Guidelines
- [ ] Review `cline_docs/authoringGuideline.md` for:
  - **Chapter Structure**: No sub-sections, only H1 title line
  - Elias's voice characteristics and evolution (including implicit guilt)
  - Pacing and immersion techniques
  - Dialogue guidelines (especially Logos communications)
  - **Religious terminology restrictions**: Heavily restrict "half-lidded eyes," "transcendent peace"
  - Show-don't-tell principles with neutral observations

### Step 2: Read Master Chapter Outline
- [ ] Review `cline_docs/chapterOutline.md` for:
  - Overall narrative structure and progression
  - Letter framework stages
  - Cross-chapter continuity
  - Thematic development across the novel

### Step 3: Study Individual Chapter Outline
- [ ] Read the specific outline in `outlines/[chapter-name].md` for:
  - Detailed scene-by-scene structure
  - Chronological event progression
  - Character actions and emotional beats
  - World-building integration points

### Step 4: Write the Chapter
- [ ] Target word count: 3,000-8,000 words (see chapterOutline.md for specific targets)
- [ ] Follow the hierarchical outline structure (I, II, III... A, B, C...)
- [ ] Maintain Elias's voice and perspective throughout
- [ ] Apply pacing techniques appropriate to scene content
- [ ] Integrate world-building naturally within events
- [ ] Ensure smooth transitions between sections

### Step 5: Save and Update Progress
- [ ] Save chapter as `chapters/[matching-outline-filename].md`
- [ ] Update `cline_docs/currentTask.md` with completion status
- [ ] Note any deviations from outline for future reference
