## I. The Weight of Solitude and Marcus's Sanctuary
   A. Elias in his research facility, surrounded by data streams and monitoring systems tracking augmentation levels across the population
   B. The investigation has been running for months, showing systematic failure as people continue to Cross despite his warnings
   C. His isolation deepens as fewer highly augmented individuals remain to communicate with, and even the lightly augmented show concerning progression patterns

   E. Logos shifts to speaking about cosmic patterns and the nature of intelligence in the universe
   F. Suggesting that the urge to Cross might be encoded into the fabric of reality itself

   D. Elias finds this theory both compelling and terrifying, as it suggests that his own continued existence might be a form of willful ignorance
   E. Elias receives an alert from his monitoring systems: Marcus has begun the augmentation process
   F. Racing to his friend's home, Elias finds Marcus in the early stages of cognitive enhancement, his grief having finally overcome his principles
   G. Marcus explains through tears that he cannot bear the isolation and wants to understand what his husband experienced
   H. Despite Elias's desperate pleas, Marcus is determined to continue, believing that augmentation might help him comprehend his loss

## V. The Desperate Intervention and First Changes
   A. Elias attempts every argument he can muster to convince Marcus to stop the augmentation process before reaching the Intelligence Horizon
   B. He shares his data, his theories, his fears about the inevitable outcome
   C. Marcus listens with the patience of someone who has already made his decision, acknowledging the risks but unable to resist the pull of understanding and connection
   D. The conversation reveals the fundamental powerlessness of logic against grief and loneliness
   E. Over the following days, Elias watches Marcus undergo the early stages of cognitive enhancement, his friend's perspective beginning to shift in subtle but noticeable ways
   F. Marcus speaks of insights and connections he never perceived before, his excitement growing despite Elias's warnings
