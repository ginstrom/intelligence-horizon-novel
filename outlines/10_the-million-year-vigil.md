## IV. The Pattern Confirmed - Thousands of Tree Eaters

   E. Elias documents the variations in timeline while recognizing the universal nature of the outcome
   F. His growing sophistication in reading the signs of those who might resist longer versus those who will Cross quickly
   G. Elias subjects the resistance-time data to quantitative analysis, plotting each individual's duration on a multi-millennial timeline and discovering that the aggregate average rises and falls in a vast, sinusoidal wave pattern across geological time
   H. Elias sometimes wanders among the residents of Eden, posing as a baseline human. He limits his treks to once every few centuries, and never exposes his powers, yet somehow legends of a kindly guardian spirit wandering the land take root among the residents.
   I. At this point Elias makes another "you" reference saying the listener probably recognizes that legend.
