## Content Summary
With Eden established and functioning, Elias settles into his role as eternal steward. This chapter covers the evolution of his stewardship over the early centuries, the outside world's complete extinction of augmented humanity, and his encounters with those who eat from the Tree of Knowledge. David's story serves as the primary example of the pattern that will define Elias's million-year vigil - communion with seekers who ultimately choose to Cross, leaving him alone again.
