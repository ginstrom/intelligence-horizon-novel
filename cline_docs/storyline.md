# Storyline Structure - The Intelligence Horizon

## Purpose
This document tracks the non-chronological narrative structure of "The Intelligence Horizon" and cross-references it to the chronological timeline established in `timeline.md`. The story is told out of sequence to maximize emotional impact and thematic revelation.

---

## Narrative Sequence Overview

### Opening Strategy
The story begins with Elias reflecting on Lydia's "Crossing" - a pivotal early event when she was among the first few thousand to Cross, at a time when the signs of the phenomenon were becoming clear. While appearing as a personal memoir, it subtly initiates the "letter" framework. The narrative voice is intimate, hinting at a specific listener without immediate revelation. This establishes emotional stakes and mystery while laying groundwork for the eventual reveal of the letter's true recipient. (See `letterFramework.md` for detailed stages).

### Structural Flow
1. **Opening Reflection:** Elias discusses Lydia's early "Crossing" and its impact
2. **Timeline Beginning:** Segue to the beginning of the chronological timeline, building up to Lydia's Crossing
3. **Eden Foreshadowing:** Mention the creation of Eden as the first seed of what would later become Eden
4. **Timeline Continuation:** Return to chronological events, progressing up to Eden's actual creation
5. **Reader Identity Hints:** Slight foreshadowing about who the "listener/reader" is
6. **Million-Year Period:** Cover the vast span with just Elias and Eden residents, Logos dormant
7. **Final Revelation:** Reader discovers the letter, Elias has Crossed, future is in reader's hands
