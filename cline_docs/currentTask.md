## Continuity Analysis Results

### Chapter 8 to Chapter 9 Transition
**Chapter 8 Ending:** Elias completes Eden's construction and begins bringing residents, ending with his commitment to stewardship: "From my hidden vantage point in the mountains, I prepared to become what I had never imagined: the invisible guardian of humanity's innocence, the shepherd of those who chose contentment over transcendence. It was, I realized, the most human thing I could do."

**Chapter 9 Opening:** "The first harvest festival taught me more about stewardship than all my careful planning had anticipated." **CONTINUITY: EXCELLENT** - Perfect transition from Eden's completion to early stewardship experience.

### Chapter 9 to Chapter 10 Transition
**Chapter 9 Ending:** Elias reflects on Adam's departure and his role as eternal witness: "Standing alone on the sand where Adam had made his final choice, I felt the weight of solitude settle over me like a familiar cloak... Yet Adam's departure also gave me hope that there might be others who could withstand the augmentation pull for longer periods."

**Chapter 10 Opening:** "After ten millennia of stewardship, Eden had achieved something unprecedented in human history: a civilization in perfect equilibrium." **CONTINUITY: GOOD** - Natural progression from early stewardship to long-term vigil, though there's a significant time jump that could be smoother.
