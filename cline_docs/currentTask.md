## Current Objective
Revise 'chapters-ja/02_the-world-that-was.md' for style, readability, and translationese, referencing 'cline_docs/translationGuideline.md' and 'cline_docs/eliasVoiceDistinction.md', and cross-checking with the English 'chapters/02_the-world-that-was.md' to ensure the plot is not changed, just the writing style.

## Context
The user has requested a full stylistic and anti-translationese revision of the Japanese translation of Chapter 2, focusing on:
- Natural Japanese flow and avoidance of translationese
- Adherence to the "kindly wise old monk" narrative voice and all stylistic, structural, and technical guidelines in 'translationGuideline.md'
- Correct narrator/dialogue register per 'eliasVoiceDistinction.md'
- Sentence length, vocabulary, punctuation, and concrete imagery per guidelines
- Plot and information fidelity to the English original

## Next Steps
1. Diagnose the current Japanese text for translationese, unnatural phrasing, and voice/register issues.
2. Cross-reference each paragraph with the English original to ensure plot and nuance are preserved.
3. Rewrite for:
   - Monk-like です/ます narration with 2-3 strategic でございます
   - Sentence length: average 20–30 chars, max 35 before comma, varied rhythm
   - JLPT N2 or below vocabulary (flag/replace heavy terms)
   - Concrete imagery and physical anchoring for emotions
   - Correct dialogue/narration register (常体 inside quotes, です/ます outside)
   - Natural punctuation (em-dash for drama, avoid colons)
   - Minimum required changes to preserve plot and information
4. Read aloud and revise for natural flow and voice consistency.
5. Run post-translation checklist (vocab, structure, imagery, dialogue, consistency).
6. Update documentation if significant translation lessons or workflow improvements are identified.
