## Current Objective
Integrate minimal-foreshadowing rule into authoring guidelines

## Context
User feedback: "Update your rules to go easy on the foreshadowing. Remind yourself that a little foreshadowing really goes a long way."

This requires updating the authoring guidelines to emphasize restraint with foreshadowing techniques throughout the novel.

## Next Steps
1. Add foreshadowing guidelines to authoringGuideline.md under Narrative Structure
2. Update chapterAuthoringWorkflow.md to include foreshadowing checks in revision process
3. Optionally add reminder to chapterOutline.md guidelines
4. Update projectRoadmap.md with completed task
