## Current Objective
Add specific authoring instructions to authoringGuideline.md

## Context
User requested adding four specific instructions to the authoring guidelines:
- Avoid summarizing at the end of chapters
- Aim for each chapter to end on an emotionally impactful note (cliffhanger or resolution)
- Make each chapter pick up seamlessly from where the previous chapter left off
- Before marking a chapter as completed, ensure all outline events are included faithfully

## Planned Actions
1. Add the four requested instructions to the appropriate section in authoringGuideline.md
2. Integrate them naturally with existing chapter structure guidelines
3. Ensure they align with current pacing and narrative structure principles

## Next Steps
1. Update authoringGuideline.md with the new instructions
2. Consider how these guidelines apply to current chapter writing workflow
