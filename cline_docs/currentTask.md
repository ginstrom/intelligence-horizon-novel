# Current Task: Enhance David's Crossing as Marcus's Motivation

## Objective
Make the Crossing of Marcus's husband David more prominent in the novel and clarify the emotional toll as motivation for Marcus to begin augmentation essentially as a form of suicide to follow his dead husband.

## Context
Currently, David's Crossing is mentioned briefly in Chapter 5 and shown through photographs and grief in Chapter 6. The task is to make this loss more visceral and immediate, showing how it drives Marcus toward augmentation as a way to reunite with David rather than genuine intellectual curiosity.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Add Visceral Flashback in Chapter 5
- **Location**: Immediately after "Roughly a month prior, Marcus's husband David had Crossed..."
- **Content**: 450-600 word first-person (Elias) flashback showing:
  - Elias and Marcus on video link trying to stabilize David
  - David's final serene expression and Marcus begging him to stop
  - David's last words: "I'll wait for you on the other side"
  - Marcus collapsing, whispering "Don't leave me"
- **Purpose**: Make readers experience the Crossing emotionally, not as background information

### 2. Deepen Grief Motif in Chapter 6
- **Shrine Scene Enhancement**: Add 2-3 sentences of physical detail (Marcus sleeping on couch beside photos, tear-stained notes)
- **Dialogue Addition**: Marcus explicitly stating: "If Crossing is the only door that leads to David, then maybe I need to walk through it"
- **Tactile Memory**: Add wedding ring in pocket that Marcus turns over while speaking

### 3. Clarify Suicidal Intent in Chapter 6
- **Augmentation Decision**: When Marcus admits starting augmentation, add line: "Every nanobot is a step toward the grave David chose first, and I'm done living on the wrong side of it"

### 4. Echo in Chapter 7 Opening
- **Metrics Scene**: Add one sentence recalling David when Elias views Marcus's progression: "The curves were identical to David'sâ€”an echo that made the loss feel freshly cut"

## Next Steps
1. Insert flashback block in Chapter 5
2. Enhance grief sections in Chapter 6 (two targeted insertions)
3. Add echo sentence in Chapter 7
4. Verify emotional continuity across all three chapters

## Success Criteria
- David's Crossing becomes a visceral, immediate presence in the narrative
- Marcus's motivation shifts from intellectual curiosity to grief-driven reunion seeking
- Augmentation is clearly framed as Marcus's chosen path to follow David
- Emotional weight of the loss drives the narrative forward rather than serving as background
