## Current Objective
Create a makefile in the project root with three essential commands for novel management and build automation.

## Context
The user has requested a makefile to streamline common project operations. The project already has Python scripts for creating a master document and word counting, plus a build directory structure. A makefile will provide standardized command interface for project management.

## Next Steps
1. Create makefile in project root with three commands:
   - `help` -- show available commands and descriptions
   - `build` -- run `python scripts/create_master.py > build/intelligence-horizon.md`
   - `wordcount` -- run `python scripts/wordcount.py`
2. Ensure makefile follows standard conventions
3. Test that commands work as expected

## Implementation Plan
- Create makefile with proper syntax and formatting
- Include help command as default target
- Add build command to generate master document
- Add wordcount command for project statistics
- Use standard makefile conventions (.PHONY targets, etc.)

## Status
✅ COMPLETED - Successfully created makefile with all requested commands

## Summary of Changes Made

### Makefile Creation:
- ✅ Created `Makefile` in project root with three essential commands
- ✅ **help command**: Default target showing available commands and descriptions
- ✅ **build command**: Runs `python scripts/create_master.py > build/intelligence-horizon.md` to generate master document
- ✅ **wordcount command**: Runs `python scripts/wordcount.py` for project statistics

### Makefile Features:
- ✅ **Standard Conventions**: Uses `.PHONY` targets for non-file targets
- ✅ **Default Target**: `help` command runs when `make` is called without arguments
- ✅ **User Feedback**: Build command includes confirmation message
- ✅ **Clean Syntax**: Proper makefile formatting with tabs and clear structure

### Testing Results:
- ✅ `make help` - Successfully displays command list
- ✅ `make build` - Successfully generates master document
- ✅ `make wordcount` - Successfully runs word count analysis

The makefile provides a standardized interface for common project operations and integrates seamlessly with the existing Python scripts and build directory structure.
