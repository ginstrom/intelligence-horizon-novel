## Current Objective
Create a .gitignore file to ignore the virtualenv folder 'venv'

## Context
The project now has a bootstrap process that creates a Python virtual environment in the `venv/` directory (added via `make bootstrap` command). This virtual environment should be excluded from version control as it contains generated files and dependencies that can be recreated from the requirements.txt file.

## Next Steps
1. Create .gitignore file in root directory
2. Add venv/ entry to ignore the virtual environment folder
3. Update currentTask.md and projectRoadmap.md to reflect completion

## Status
✅ COMPLETED

## Previous Task Completion
✅ **Build Error Fix** - Successfully fixed smartypants library compatibility issue in create_master.py script. Build process now works correctly with `make build` generating proper output with smart quote conversion.
