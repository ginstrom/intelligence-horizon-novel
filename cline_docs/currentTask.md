## Current Objective
Update population proportions across all documentation and chapters to reflect new canonical split: approximately 2 billion baseline humans, 2 billion lightly augmented humans, and 2 billion highly augmented humans (total ~6 billion at novel's opening).

## Context
The user wants to make a sweeping change to the proportions of people who are baseline, lightly augmented, and highly augmented. They should each constitute about a third of humanity, so with the population decline at the time of the novel's opening, that would be a starting count of about 2 billion each. This requires updating outlines and chapters to reflect this change.

## Previous Context
Successfully completed Chapter 8 following the detailed outline in outlines/08_design-build-first-years.md. This chapter represents a major transition in the narrative, covering Elias's inheritance of Logos's vast powers and the complete arc from Eden's conception through its design, construction, population integration, and first years of operation.

## Completed Actions
1. ✅ Drafted chapters/08_design-build-first-years.md following outline structure I-XII:
   - The Silence After and Logos's Final Communication
   - The Power Transfer and Inheritance
   - Survey of Remaining Humanity and the Choice of Service
   - Location Selection and Environmental Genesis
   - Hidden Infrastructure and Tree Installation
   - Voice Programming and Tree Accessibility
   - Population Outreach and the Great Invitation
   - First Arrivals and Community Integration
   - Rule Implementation and System Activation
   - Stewardship Role and Community Flourishing
   - The First Years and Learning Invisible Guidance
   - Natural Cycles and the Foundation Complete
2. ✅ Applied all authoring guidelines: show-don't-tell, minimal foreshadowing, pacing variation
3. ✅ Achieved target word count: approximately 6,500 words (based on length)
4. ✅ Maintained Stage 3 Letter Framework tone: clearer address to eventual successor
5. ✅ Included exactly ONE enhancement self-reference in opening paragraph (carry-over rule)
6. ✅ User made edits to improve flow, world-building details, and narrative consistency
7. ✅ Revised Buddhist-coded language throughout chapter:
   - "transcendent path" → "path" (4 instances)
   - "transcendent state" → "state"
   - "transcendence inevitable" → "Crossing inevitable"
   - "serene and accepted" → "peaceful and accepted"
   - "lead to transcendence" → "lead to Crossing"
   - "depart and transcend" → "depart and Cross"

## Key Guidelines Successfully Followed
- Enhancement Reference Cap: Single reference in opening paragraph only
- Voice: First-person past tense, highly intelligent but emotionally relatable
- Tone Balance: Power and responsibility, service vs. dominion, creation and stewardship
- Minimal Foreshadowing: Subtle hints only, no heavy-handed references
- Show-Don't-Tell: Conveyed themes through action, dialogue, and sensory descriptions
- Letter Framework Stage 3: Clearer address to successor but not yet full revelation

## Chapter 8 Achievements
- **Power Transition**: Successfully showed Elias's inheritance of godlike abilities and choice of service over dominion
- **Eden Creation**: Detailed the complete process from conception to functioning sanctuary with user-enhanced world-building
- **Population Integration**: Demonstrated bringing baseline and lightly augmented humans together as simply human
- **Stewardship Philosophy**: Established Elias's approach to invisible guidance and preservation of choice
- **Foundation Setting**: Prepared for the million-year vigil that follows with clear transition
- **Voice Evolution**: Began transition toward more direct address to eventual successor

## User Enhancements
- Improved Logos dialogue with more natural, tired-but-relieved tone
- Enhanced world-building: Eden as raised continent in isolated ocean
- Clarified augmentation prevention mechanisms and germline protection
- Multiple Sacred Groves distributed throughout Eden for accessibility
- Refined Tree of Life mechanics and memory effects
- Streamlined narrative flow and removed redundant elements

## Population Proportion Updates - COMPLETED

### Files Updated
1. ✅ cline_docs/techStack.md - Updated Population Distribution section
2. ✅ cline_docs/timeline.md - Updated initial population bullet
3. ✅ cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md - Updated Neural Augmentation → Population Structure
4. ✅ cline_docs/chapterOutline.md - Updated population reference in Chapter 8 content
5. ✅ outlines/08_design-build-first-years.md - Updated survey paragraph
6. ✅ chapters/08_design-build-first-years.md - Updated both population count references

### Changes Made
- **Baseline humans**: "several billion" → "about two billion"
- **Lightly augmented humans**: "several million" → "about two billion"
- **Highly augmented humans**: Updated to "about two billion (most destined to Cross soon after novel's opening)"
- **Total Earth population**: Now approximately 6 billion at novel's opening, down from earlier peak

### Consistency Achieved
All documentation and narrative materials now reflect the new canonical population split of roughly one-third each:
- ~2 billion baseline humans
- ~2 billion lightly augmented humans  
- ~2 billion highly augmented humans

The sweeping change to population proportions has been successfully implemented across all relevant files while maintaining narrative consistency and world-building logic.

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with Chapter 9: "Early Stewardship and the Tree Eaters" when requested, focusing on the early centuries of Eden's operation and Elias's encounters with Tree of Knowledge eaters.
