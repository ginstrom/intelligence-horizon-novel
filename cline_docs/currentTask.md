# Current Task: Create EN->JA Translation Glossary

## Objective
Create a comprehensive glossary document "cline_docs/en_ja_glossary.md" for the English to Japanese translation of "The Intelligence Horizon" novel. This glossary will serve as a reference for maintaining consistency throughout the translation process and will be based on the chapter outline and translation guidelines.

## Context from Documentation Review
- **Project Status**: Novel is complete with 11 chapters covering Elias's journey from AI researcher to Eden's eternal steward
- **Translation Framework**: "Kindly wise old monk" narrative voice established in translationGuideline.md
- **Key Story Elements**: Crossing phenomenon, Intelligence Horizon, Eden Project, Trees of Knowledge and Life
- **Character Development**: Elias (creator-steward), Lydia (skeptic-to-enthusiast), Marcus (final colleague), Logos (cryptic AI)
- **Thematic Focus**: Transcendence, choice, responsibility, cycles of consciousness

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Terminology Extraction
Extract key terms from chapterOutline.md and existing documentation:

**A. Central Phenomena**
- Crossing / Intelligence Horizon / Neural Augmentation
- Tree of Knowledge / Tree of Life / Eden Project
- Baseline humans / Lightly augmented / Highly augmented

**B. Character-Specific Terms**
- Character names and titles
- Relationship descriptors
- Professional terminology

**C. Technological Concepts**
- AI systems and interfaces
- Augmentation categories and processes
- Eden's hidden infrastructure

**D. Philosophical/Thematic Terms**
- Transcendence-related vocabulary
- Choice and consciousness concepts
- Stewardship and service terminology

### Phase 2: Translation Strategy Application
Apply translationGuideline.md principles:

**A. Narrative Voice Consistency**
- Terms that support "kindly wise old monk" tone
- Respectful but accessible vocabulary choices
- Balance of technical precision with readability

**B. Cultural Adaptation**
- Avoid explicit religious terminology while preserving transcendent atmosphere
- Use universal human experiences for spiritual concepts
- Maintain scientific credibility in technical terms

**C. Readability Optimization**
- Favor established Japanese SF terminology
- Minimize katakana where Japanese alternatives exist
- Target JIS第1水準 + common 第2水準 kanji usage

### Phase 3: Consistency Framework
Establish systematic approach:

**A. Primary/Secondary Translation Options**
- Preferred translation with alternatives for context variation
- Usage notes for different narrative situations
- Character-specific vocabulary variations

**B. Compound Term Handling**
- Consistent treatment of technical compounds
