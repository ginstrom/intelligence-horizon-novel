2. **Dialogue Attribution**: A few instances where speaker could be clearer
3. **Transition Smoothness**: One minor jump between Alice scene and return to lab

## Continuity Analysis Results

### Chapter 4 to Chapter 5 Transition
**Chapter 4 Ending:** Elias and Marcus recognize investigation failure, with Marcus suggesting approaching Logos differently about purpose rather than prevention. Elias decides to try direct confrontation.

**Chapter 5 Opening:** Elias begins with direct systematic questioning of Logos, following Marcus's suggestion. **CONTINUITY: EXCELLENT** - seamless transition from strategy discussion to implementation.

### Chapter 5 to Chapter 6 Transition  
**Chapter 5 Ending:** Marcus hints at dangerous consideration of augmentation, setting up personal stakes and investigation's end.

**Chapter 6 Opening:** Focuses on isolation and Marcus as last hope, then reveals David's Crossing as Marcus's motivation. **CONTINUITY: GOOD** - emotional flow maintained, though Chapter 6 could reference the direct Logos confrontation failure more explicitly.

### Event Consistency Check
- **David's Crossing:** Mentioned in Chapter 5 as recent (month ago), detailed in Chapter 6. **CONSISTENT**
- **Alice Jimenez intervention:** Chapter 5 specific event, not duplicated elsewhere. **UNIQUE**
- **Logos dialogue patterns:** Consistent dual communication style across chapters. **CONSISTENT**
- **Marcus's progression:** Logical development from resistance to consideration to action. **CONSISTENT**
