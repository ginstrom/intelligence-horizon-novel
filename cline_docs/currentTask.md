## Current Objective
Revise 'chapters-ja/06_the-last-hope.md' for style, readability, and translationese, referencing 'cline_docs/translationGuideline.md' and 'cline_docs/eliasVoiceDistinction.md', and cross-checking with the English 'chapters/06_the-last-hope.md' to ensure the plot is not changed, just the writing style.

## Context
The user has requested a full stylistic and anti-translationese revision of the Japanese translation of Chapter 6, focusing on:
- Natural Japanese flow and avoidance of translationese
- Adherence to the "kindly wise old monk" narrative voice and all stylistic, structural, and technical guidelines in 'translationGuideline.md'
- Correct narrator/dialogue register per 'eliasVoiceDistinction.md'
- Sentence length, vocabulary, punctuation, and concrete imagery per guidelines
- Plot and information fidelity to the English original

## Next Steps
1. Diagnose the current Japanese text for translationese, unnatural phrasing, and voice/register issues.
2. Cross-reference each paragraph with the English original to ensure plot and nuance are preserved.
3. Rewrite for:
   - Monk-like です/ます narration with 2-3 strategic でございます
   - Sentence length: average 20–30 chars, max 35 before comma, varied rhythm
   - JLPT N2 or below vocabulary (flag/replace heavy terms)
   - Concrete imagery and physical anchoring for emotions
   - Correct dialogue/narration register (常体 inside quotes, です/ます outside)
   - Natural punctuation (em-dash for drama, avoid colons)
   - Minimum required changes to preserve plot and information
4. Read aloud and revise for natural flow and voice consistency.
5. Run post-translation checklist (vocab, structure, imagery, dialogue, consistency).
6. Update documentation if significant translation lessons or workflow improvements are identified.

## Detailed Plan for Chapter 6 Revision

### 1. Preparation
- Review 'chapters-ja/06_the-last-hope.md' for translationese, voice drift, and unnatural phrasing.
- Cross-reference each section with 'chapters/06_the-last-hope.md' to ensure plot, nuance, and emotional beats are preserved.

### 2. Revision Guidelines
- Apply "kindly wise old monk" narrative voice (です/ます調, 2-3 でございます per chapter, varied rhythm).
- Ensure narrator/dialogue distinction: narration is です/ます, dialogue inside 「」 is 常体 (plain form) for Elias, natural register for other characters.
- Break up long sentences; target average 20–30 characters, max 35 before comma, max 2 commas per sentence.
- Replace or flag vocabulary above JLPT N2; use accessible alternatives where possible.
- Anchor emotions in physical/sensory detail; convert abstract feelings to concrete imagery.
- Use em-dash（――）for dramatic pauses, avoid colons except in headings.
- Maintain technical and philosophical accuracy, but prioritize readability and natural Japanese flow.
- Make minimum required changes to preserve all plot and information.

### 3. Workflow
- Work section by section, revising for style, voice, and naturalness.
- After revision, read aloud to check for rhythm, voice consistency, and dialogue naturalness.
- Run post-translation checklist from 'translationGuideline.md'.
- If significant translation lessons or workflow improvements are identified, update documentation accordingly.

### 4. Documentation
- If major translation challenges or workflow improvements are encountered, update cline_docs/translationGuideline.md or related files.
- If revision leads to significant changes in chapter structure or content, update codebaseSummary.md.

### 5. Testing
- Ensure revised chapter meets all style, readability, and anti-translationese criteria.
- Confirm that all plot points and emotional beats match the English original.
