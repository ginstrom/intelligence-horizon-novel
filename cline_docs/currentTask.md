## Current Objective
Align chapter outlines between `cline_docs/chapterOutline.md` and individual files in `outlines/` directory to ensure consistency in events, metadata, and thematic focus.

## Context
The user has identified potential mismatches between the master chapter outline and the individual chapter outlines. This alignment is critical for maintaining consistency across the novel's structure and ensuring authors follow accurate guidance.

## Next Steps
1. Compare each chapter's content between master outline and individual outline files
2. Identify discrepancies in:
   - Event sequences and scene ordering
   - Metadata (Narrative Beat, Timeline Reference, Letter Framework Stage, Word Count Target)
   - Thematic focus alignment
3. Update files to ensure consistency, treating individual outlines as source of truth for scene details
4. Fix any obvious structural issues (e.g., incorrect section numbering)
5. Verify metadata alignment across all chapters

## Implementation Plan
- Read and compare all 11 chapter outlines systematically
- Document discrepancies found
- Apply targeted updates to align the documents
- Ensure thematic focus matches actual event sequences
- Verify all metadata fields are consistent

## Status
✅ COMPLETED - Successfully aligned chapter outlines between master and individual files

## Summary of Changes Made

### Structural Fixes:
1. **Chapter 4 Section Numbering**: Fixed incorrect section numbering that started with "VIII" instead of "I"
   - Renumbered all sections from I through VIII in proper sequence

### Metadata Alignment:
2. **Added Missing Metadata Blocks**: Added standardized metadata to chapters 1-5:
   - **Narrative Beat**: Aligned with master outline specifications
   - **Timeline Reference**: Matched to established timeline structure  
   - **Letter Framework Stage**: Consistent with progression stages
   - **Word Count Target**: Aligned with master outline targets

### Files Updated:
- ✅ `outlines/01_memory-of-loss.md` - Added metadata block
- ✅ `outlines/02_the-world-that-was.md` - Added metadata block  
- ✅ `outlines/03_signs-and-portents.md` - Added metadata block
- ✅ `outlines/04_the-investigation-begins.md` - Fixed section numbering + added metadata block
- ✅ `outlines/05_divine-riddles.md` - Added metadata block
- ✅ `cline_docs/chapterOutline.md` - Removed redundant sections that were moved to Chapter 4

### Files Already Aligned:
- ✅ `outlines/06_the-last-hope.md` - Already had proper metadata
- ✅ `outlines/07_the-final-crossing.md` - Already had proper metadata  
- ✅ `outlines/08_design-build-first-years.md` - Already had proper metadata
- ✅ `outlines/09_early-stewardship-tree-eaters.md` - Already had proper metadata
- ✅ `outlines/10_the-million-year-vigil.md` - Already had proper metadata
- ✅ `outlines/11_the-successors-choice.md` - Already had proper metadata

## Verification
All chapter outlines now have consistent:
- Metadata blocks with four key fields (Narrative Beat, Timeline Reference, Letter Framework Stage, Word Count Target)
- Proper section numbering (I, II, III, etc.)
- Content alignment between master outline and individual chapter files
- Thematic focus matching actual event sequences

The alignment ensures authors will have accurate, consistent guidance when writing each chapter.
