# Current Task: Create Japanese Metadata File

## Objective
Create a Japanese version of metadata.yml file (metadata-ja.yml) by translating the descriptive content while keeping technical fields unchanged.

## Context
The project has both English and Japanese versions of the novel "Intelligence Horizon". A Japanese metadata file is needed to properly support the Japanese translation build process and provide appropriate metadata for Japanese readers.

## Implementation Plan
1. ✅ Read essential documentation for context
2. ✅ Update currentTask.md with new task objectives
3. ✅ Create metadata-ja.yml with appropriate translations
4. ✅ Verify technical fields are properly configured for Japanese
5. ✅ Ensure consistency with existing Japanese translation approach
