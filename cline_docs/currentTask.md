# Current Task: Rebalance Chapters 9 and 10 for Better Narrative Flow

## Objective
Restructure chapters 9 and 10 to address pacing imbalance where Chapter 9 is too bare while Chapter 10 reads as a slog with a parade of four resistant people.

## User Requirements
- **Chapter 9**: Cover the first 10,000 years of Eden's development
- **Move First Resistant Person**: Transfer the first of the two people from Chapter 10 to Chapter 9; they eat the Tree's fruit, augment, then Cross
- **Chapter 10 Opening**: Begin with long-term development of Eden, describing the unique society and culture that develops
- **Eden Society Description**: How peace and harmony have replaced strife and competition; how smaller stable population relieves pressure that destroyed other societies
- **Chapter 10 Resistant People**: Move on to the second of the resistant people, spaced out more - 100,000 years, then 350,000 years

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Update Chapter 9 Outline
1. **Expand Timeline**: Change from "early centuries" to "first 10,000 years"
2. **Move David's Story**: Transfer David's complete arc (arrival, 500-year companionship, Crossing) from Chapter 10 to Chapter 9
3. **Add Temporal Milestones**: Insert beats marking key centuries/millennia showing Eden's development
4. **Expand Stewardship Evolution**: Show Elias's growth over millennia rather than centuries

### Phase 2: Update Chapter 10 Outline  
1. **New Opening Section**: Add comprehensive description of Eden's mature society after 10,000 years
2. **Cultural Development**: Detail unique peaceful civilization, stable population dynamics, harmony vs competition
3. **Remove David**: Eliminate David's story sections (now in Chapter 9)
4. **Restructure Resistant People**: 
   - Resistant #2 at ~100,000 years mark
   - Resistant #3 at ~350,000 years mark
   - Space out encounters with more development between them
5. **Reduce "Parade Effect"**: Transform from four rapid encounters to two well-spaced, developed stories

### Phase 3: Update Documentation
1. **Chapter Outline Summary**: Update `cline_docs/chapterOutline.md` to reflect new balance
2. **Continuity Notes**: Add notes about new time gaps and character movements
3. **Timeline Consistency**: Ensure all references align with new structure
