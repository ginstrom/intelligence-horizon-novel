- [ ] Develop his internal conflict regarding "Crossing"
- [ ] Show his evolution from fear to acceptance to godlike responsibility
- [ ] Create compelling supporting characters who undergo "Crossing"

## Key Themes

### Free Will vs Determinism
- Do minds inevitably follow certain trajectories as intelligence increases?
- Is the urge to "Cross" natural or manipulated?
- How does Elias maintain agency in the face of overwhelming intelligence?

### The Singularity as Suicide
- Is extreme intelligence inherently anti-life?
- What drives highly intelligent beings to voluntarily end their existence?
- How does this relate to the burden of consciousness?

### Myth as Language Gap
- Logos speaks in parables and riddles due to intelligence gaps
- Language becomes insufficient beyond certain cognitive distances
- How do we communicate across vast differences in understanding?

### Godhood as Burden
- Elias gains godlike power but chooses service over dominion
- The responsibility of creating and maintaining Eden
- The loneliness of being the last of his kind
