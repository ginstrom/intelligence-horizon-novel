# Chapter Review Guide
- Ensure chapter complies with @authoringGuideline.md
- Check end of previous chapter and beginning of next chapter for consistency/continuity.
- Make sure that the same event is not mentioned de novo in multiple chapters.
- Check chapter for: spelling, grammar, pacing, immersion, writing quality.
- **Intervention Scene Guidelines**: Ensure each intervention attempt offers distinct emotional tone or outcome. Avoid repetitive "we tried and failed" passages without additional narrative value. Each intervention should advance character development or plot progression.
